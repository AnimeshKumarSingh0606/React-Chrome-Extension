# React-Chrome-Extension
An extension that will capture all the URL requests made using TCP/IP based protocol by a website when it first loads. 

Note this will only work absolutely fine only when the page is loaded in MDN (and not Just any where it will be working 100% correct)

This is developed using yarn because it is quite faster than npm and I faced quite a few issues in the initial phase itself that is why I used yarn and it's my first hands on with yarn .

so please help me to let me know if there is any specific module or library which helps easy our life in building extensions with node .
